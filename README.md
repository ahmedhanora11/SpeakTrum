**BRIDGING COMMUNICATION GAPS!**

> OVERVIEW

Speaktrum is an innovative project that seeks to empower autistic individuals by enhancing their communication abilities during video calls, particularly on platforms. Through the utilization of a face detection program, Speaktrum intelligently identifies and interprets user emotions in real-time, providing personalized guidance to bridge communication gaps. Video calls can often be overwhelming and anxiety-inducing for individuals on the autism spectrum, but Speaktrum addresses this challenge by detecting signs of stress or fear and acting as a supportive companion. The system offers personalized prompts and suggestions to help users stay calm and navigate challenging moments, ensuring a more comfortable communication experience. With Speaktrum as their guiding force, individuals receive tailored and empathetic guidance based on their unique emotional needs, including reminders to take deep breaths, soothing techniques, and suggestions for brief breaks. Our mission is to create an inclusive and accessible virtual environment where autistic individuals can communicate effectively and confidently. Speaktrum serves as a bridge, minimizing communication gaps during video calls and facilitating meaningful connections for those with autism spectrum disorder. Through this innovative system, we aim to empower individuals to discover their voice, express themselves with confidence, and embrace the spectrum of their abilities
